Not sure why, but I think <tt>sortMe</tt> will not be sorted.

At least 10 keys should be inserted. If we want to break two 3-key nodes, we must encounter them as parent-children. Assuming the parent 3-key node has three other 1-key children, the minimum number of insertions, counting the last insertion that breaks the two nodes, would be: 3 + 3 + 3*1 + 1 = 10. <br><br>

Through trial-and-error, I found a sequence of 11 insertions that satisfy the requirements, namely <i>3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 10</i>, in that order. <b>In other words, either my derivation above is wrong (should be at least 11 instead of 10), or there exists another example with 10 insertions only. Any input is greatly appreciated.</b><br><br>

In the meantime, here's a few steps during those 11 insertions.

<pre>
  3 4 5        4            4 6            4 6           2 4 6
          7   / \     9    / | \     2    / | \     0   / | | \
         -&gt;  3  567  -&gt;   3  5 789  -&gt;  123 5 789  -&gt;  01 3 5 789</pre>
<br>
Inserting 10 would then break the node <i>246</i> and <i>789</i>
<br><br>

<b>c. </b>
<pre>
if (no children): return the key since this is a leaf node
else: we keep track of a counter <i>depth</i>, which is set to 0 initially at the root.
  if (depth is even):
    return minimax(this.right, depth+1) 
  else:
    return minimax(this.left, depth+1)</pre>

<b>Problem 4.</b>  (9 points) <b>Data Structures.</b><br>

<b>a. </b>
<pre>
a 
Visited order, starting from <i>a</i>, is: <i>a c g e b d f</i>.
<br><br>

<b>b. </b>
For each vertex <tt>u</tt>, we need to find an edge incident on it by checking every other vertex <tt>w</tt> such that <tt>(u, w)</tt> (if <tt>u</tt> w), or <tt>(w, u)</tt> is in the hash table, and that we haven't visited <tt>w</tt> previously. Doing so, in the worst case, would take <tt>O(|V|<sup>2</sup></tt>), which is much worse than the normal <tt>O(|V|+|E|)</tt> for DFS.  
<br><br>

<b>c. </b>
Let's say you have <tt>N</tt> buckets, and <tt>n = N-1</tt> items. The load factor is currently approaching 1. If you add two more items, you resize up. If you then remove two items, you resize down. Hence, a sequence of two <tt>add()</tt>s/<tt>remove()</tt>s would cause you to resize every now and then, and go bankrupt. Hence, the amortized running time of the two operations is not <tt>O(1)</tt>.  
<br><br>

<b>d. </b>
I believe this is similar to the derivation of randomized quicksort's running time in Lecture 38. We have a 1/2 chance of finding a good index, which we can then drop 1/4 of the items in the sorted array. Let <i>D</i>(<i>n</i>) be a random variable equal to the depth of an arbitrary key in a random <i>n</i>-index, <i>retarded binary search</i>. By the same derivation in Lecture 38,
<blockquote>
E[<i>D</i>(<i>n</i>)] ≤ 2 log<sub>4/3</sub> <i>n</i>.

<b>Problem 5.</b>  (6 points) <b>Dynamic Median Finding.</b><br>

<b>a. </b>
When the number of elements is odd, return<br>
</pre><ul>
  <li>min key of min heap if size(min heap) &gt; size(max heap)</li>
  <li>max key of max heap if size(min heap) 
</li></ul>
If the number of elements is even, return the max key of max heap, since every key of max heap is less than or equal to every key of min heap.
<br><br>

<b>b. </b>
<ul>
  <li>If the inserted key is bigger than or equal to the root of the min heap, insert it into the min heap.</li>
  <li>Else if the inserted key is smaller than or equal to the root of the max heap, insert it into the max heap.</li>
  <li>Otherwise (<tt>max(maxHeap) ), choose either heap arbitrarily and insert it into that heap.</tt></li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>c. </b>
<ul>
  <li>If the inserted key is bigger than or equal to the root of the max heap, insert it into the min heap (max heap doesn't need it).</li>
  <li>Else (this new key absolutely needs to go into the max heap):
    <ul>
      <li>Pop the max of the max heap via <tt>removeMax()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Insert that popped key to the min heap - it will serve as the new root (minimum key) of the min heap.</li>
      <li>Insert the new key into the max heap.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Problem 6.</b>  (7 points) <b>Binary Search Tree Insertion with Size and Height Fields.</b><br>

<pre><tt>
public class BinaryTreeNode {
  int key, size, height;
  BinaryTreeNode parent, left, right;

  // Constructor with key k, parent p.
  public BinaryTreeNode(int k, BinaryTreeNode p) {
    key = k; parent = p;
    size = 1; height = 0; left = null; right = null; 
  }

  // Inserts key k into "this" node's subtree; updates all sizes and heights.
  <b>public void insert(int k) {
    if (k = b ? a:b;
